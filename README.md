<h1>**MVP Goals**</h1>
<ul>
  <li>As a player, I want to have an animated rope so that it shows up and down frame to make the motion more engaging.</li>
  <li>As a player, I want the game to recognize if I step on the rope so its more challenging.</li>
  <li>As a player, i want the rope to move faster periodically then slow down to make it more challenging.</li>
  <li>As a player, I want to be able to jump on a button click.</li>
  <li>As a player, I want to be able to see my score to know my progress.</li>
  <li>As a player, i want to identify who is player 1 and who is player 2.</li>
  <li>As a player, I want to minus the score based on bad jumps to make it more challenging.</li>
  <li>As a player, I want the end screen to identify the winner or show that we had a tie based on our score.</li>
  <li>As a player, I want to be able to restart the game at any time just in case I make a mistake.</li>
 </ul>
<br/>
<h1>**Stretch Goals**</h1>
<ul>
 <li>As a player, I would like to see random scenery to keep the game fresh.(i.e jumping on the moon, or in the jungle)</li>
  <li>As a player, i would like to add a male character to have more representation.</li>
  <li>As a player, i would like to have music and sound effects to make it more immersive.</li>
  <li>As a player, i would like to be able to use the space bar to make the usability more accessible and seamless.</li>
